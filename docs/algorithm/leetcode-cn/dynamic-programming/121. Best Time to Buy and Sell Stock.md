> You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
>
> You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
> 
> Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

$$
min = min(min, prices[i])
$$

$$
maxProfit = prices[i] - min
$$

$$
f(x) = max(f(x-1), maxProfit)
$$

```ts
function maxProfit(prices: number[]): number {
    const dp: number[] = [0]
    let min = prices[0]

    for (let i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
        min = Math.min(min, prices[i])
        dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 1], prices[i] - min)
    }

    return dp[prices.length - 1]
};
```
